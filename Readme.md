# C++ Object-Oriented Programming Modules

## Chapter I: Introduction

**C++** is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes" ([source: Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B)).

The goal of these modules is to introduce you to **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**. This will be the starting point of your C++ journey. Many languages are recommended to learn OOP. We decided to choose C++ since it’s derived from your old friend, C.

Because this is a complex language, and in order to keep things simple, your code will comply with the C++98 standard. We are aware modern C++ is way different in a lot of aspects. So if you want to become a proficient C++ developer, it’s up to you to go further after the 42 Common Core!

## Getting Started

To begin your C++ journey:
1. Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., GCC, Clang).
2. Familiarize yourself with basic C syntax if you haven't already.
3. Dive into the modules and start coding!
